# Student Performance Prediction

## 🚀 Project Description
This project uses a machine learning model to predict the final academic performance (final grade) of students. The prediction is based on a variety of social, demographic, and school-related features, providing insights into factors that influence student success.

***

## 📊 Dataset
The data is from the "Student Performance Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features collected from two Portuguese secondary schools.

## 📈 Results
The initial Random Forest Classifier model achieved an **accuracy of 35%** on the test data. This serves as a baseline result. Further improvements can be made through more in-depth feature engineering, trying different classification models, and hyperparameter tuning.
